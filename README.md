# CCA-F Study Plan & Quiz Engine

Two companion apps for the **Claude Certified Architect -- Foundations** exam: a structured 4-week study plan and a 500-question quiz engine.

## Study Plan (`/`)

A week-by-week battle plan covering all 5 exam domains, organized into 4 phases:

| Week | Phase | Goal | Target Score |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Foundation Sprint | Build mental models for all 5 domains + baseline diagnostic | 70% |
| 2 | Build Sprint | 4 hands-on projects mapped to all 6 exam scenarios | 80% |
| 3 | Depth Sprint | Close gaps, master tradeoffs, drill weak domains | 85% |
| 4 | Exam Sprint | Full practice exams, speed drilling, exam day | 90%+ |

### Features

- **6 tabs**: Weekly Plan, **Brain Map**, Concepts (30 nodes), Projects, Decision Rules (11 rules), Cheat Sheet
- **Theme toggle** (top-right): cycle dark → grey → light; choice persists in localStorage
- **Daily KPIs** with measurable targets for each study day
- **Daily closure assessments** linking to specific quiz engine modes
- **Progress tracking** with localStorage-persisted checkboxes on tasks and concepts
- **Completion percentages** per tab displayed in the header

### The 6 tabs

**Weekly Plan** -- Expand any week, then individual days. Each day lists what to study, a KPI, and a closure quiz reference. Colored borders indicate the domain.

**Brain Map** -- Radial SVG view of all 30 concepts across 5 domains with cross-domain connection arcs. Click any concept to see why it matters in production, related concepts across domains, curated learning resources, common failure modes, and exam distractor-trap phrases. Designed for scenario questions that span multiple domains.

**Concepts** -- 30 testable concepts organized by domain with weight percentages. Your self-test: explain any leaf node from memory.

**Projects** -- 4 production-style apps mapped to exam scenarios.

**Decision Rules** -- 11 meta-rules that eliminate distractors. Each includes what it means, why it matters, and signal words.

**Cheat Sheet** -- 30+ one-line decision rules grouped by category, aligned to the 30 official task statements.

## Quiz Engine (`/quiz`)

500 elite-difficulty multiple-choice questions grounded in the 6 official exam scenarios with detailed explanations.

### Question distribution

| Domain | Weight | Questions | Task Statements |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| D1: Agentic Architecture & Orchestration | 27% | 135 | 1.1--1.7 |
| D2: Tool Design & MCP Integration | 18% | 90 | 2.1--2.5 |
| D3: Claude Code Configuration & Workflows | 20% | 100 | 3.1--3.6 |
| D4: Prompt Engineering & Structured Output | 20% | 100 | 4.1--4.6 |
| D5: Context Management & Reliability | 15% | 75 | 5.1--5.6 |

### Difficulty

- ~64% hard, ~36% medium. No easy questions.
- Every question tests architectural judgment and tradeoffs, not memorization
- Distractors are deliberately tricky -- they sound correct to surface-level knowledge
- Each question includes detailed explanations for all 4 choices
- Each question has a "Why this matters" field tied to real business outcomes

### Quiz modes

- **Full Exam Simulation** -- 60 weighted random questions, timed
- **Domain Drill** -- All questions from a single domain
- **Task Statement Drill** -- Questions from a specific task statement (e.g., "1.3: Subagent Context")
- **Scenario Mode** -- Questions filtered by exam scenario (1--6)
- **Weak Spots** -- Prioritizes your lowest-scoring task statements
- **Review Mistakes** -- Only previously incorrect questions

### Analytics

- Per-domain and per-task-statement score tracking
- Weak spot identification across all 30 task statements
- Session history with accuracy trends
- All data persisted in localStorage
